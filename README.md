# Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine

A program based on Borges' description of Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine. (Python 3.5.2)

Ramon Llull's thinking machine is a machine that combines various words together and forms a random expression from them. First versions focus on the attributes of God and their unity, and a later version proposed in Gulliver's Travels claims that it can produce many works of Arts and Sciences. Borges' own usage involves the finding the true color of a tiger. Indeed,  he makes use of a 'blue tiger' in one of his stories, which may as well mean that his choice of color was totally random. 

The essay "Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine" is written by Jorge Luis Borges in 1937.
